## üí° Features

- There's no magic here. Zunder-zsh isn't a framework and tries to be clear
about how it works.

See [zunder-prompt](https://github.com/Warbacon/zunder-prompt).
- Almost instant start-up.
- Syntax highlighting and autosuggestions.
- [Exa](https://github.com/eza-community/eza) integration.
- Automatic installation.

## ü§î Why should I use it?

Zunder-zsh has been designed so that any user can use it almost instantly
without having to learn new things, just run the script and you are ready to go.
Here there are no unnecessary things and everything works fast.

**However**, if you are a more advanced user, you may need to extend zunder-zsh
more than usual, thus making the configuration more complicated than if you 
weren't using zunder-zsh. If this happens to you, I recommend that you create
your own configuration, either by forking this project or creating it from
scratch.

### Zunder-zsh vs Oh My Zsh

Oh My Zsh is a framework, **zunder-zsh isn't**. This means that while Oh My Zsh
requires you to configure your shell how they want, zunder-zsh doesn't,
since its level of abstraction is very low, making it so that anyone can
understand what is happening behind the scenes and can be modified in the way
you prefer.

## üíä Compatibility

Although zunder-zsh can run on any POSIX-compliant operating system,
the installation script will have more functionality on
the following operating systems:

- Arch Linux and derivatives (EndeavourOS, Manjaro, etc.).
- Debian and derivatives (Ubuntu, Linux Mint, etc.).
- Fedora and derivatives (NobaraOS, Ultramarine Linux, etc.).
- OpenSUSE and derivatives (Tumbleweed, Leap, GeckoLinux, etc.).
- Void Linux.
- MacOS.
- Android (using [termux](https://termux.dev)).

**Works also in wsl**, but syntax highlighting will be disabled
because it produces input lag when typing.

## üöÄ Getting started

### Nerd fonts

Depending on your operating system, the required icons will be installed
if needed, but may require additional configuration. 

If you don't see the icons correctly and don't want to complicate your life,
you can install a [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/)
and set it as default on your terminal.

> I recommend JetBrainsMono Nerd Font

You can use [Termux:Styling](https://f-droid.org/es/packages/com.termux.styling)
on Android and set as font, for example, Fira Code.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository locally:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Warbacon/zunder-zsh.git
```

2. Enter the cloned repository and run the install script:

```sh
cd ./zunder-zsh
./install.sh
```

## üñåÔ∏è Customizing zunder-zsh

You can add custom configurations to zunder-zsh in 
`~/.config/zsh/user-config.zsh` to make sure that it's not overwritten
if you update zunder-zsh.

Here are some additional settings you can add:

### Disable autosuggestions

```sh
ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_STRATEGY=()
```

### Change the symbol and its color in the prompt's character

Zunder-zsh uses [zunder-prompt](https://github.com/Warbacon/zunder-prompt) as
its prompt. To customize its symbol and color, you can modify
the following environment variables:

```sh
ZUNDER_PROMPT_CHAR="‚ùØ"             # default value: "ÔÉß"
ZUNDER_PROMPT_CHAR_COLOR="green"   # default value: 3 ("yellow")
```

`ZUNDER_PROMPT_CHAR_COLOR` does accept any color between 0 and 255
or a color name.

### Fzf integration

> You need to install ``fzf`` manually

```sh
zinit snippet https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/fzf/master/shell/key-bindings.zsh
```

This enables the integration of fzf into zsh, making it possible to use
the following keybindings:

| Keybinding | Description                                   |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Ctrl+r     | Search history of shell commands.             |
| Ctrl+t     | List files and folders in current directory.  |
| Alt+c      | Fuzzy change directory.                       |

### Exa integration

Zunder-zsh will enable exa integration automatically if ``exa`` is installed.
You must install ``exa`` or ``eza`` manually for this to happen.

## üîß Troubleshooting

**If you find any error in zunder-zsh, I would appreciate if you open an issue
and I will try to help you as soon as possible.**

If you didn't like it or want to go back to your previous configuration,
you can run the ``uninstall.sh`` script located in this same repository:

```sh
./uninstall.sh
```

Additionally, if you used previously another shell, you can revert it using
the following command:

```sh
sudo usermod -s $(which bash) $USER
```

You can change bash for the shell of your choice.
