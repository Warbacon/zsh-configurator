## üöÄ Getting started

### Dependencies

Although icons will be installed automatically, it's **recommended to install
a [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads)
and set it as default font in your terminal**. On **Android**, you can install
[Termux:Styling](https://f-droid.org/es/packages/com.termux.styling) and use for example Fira Code.

Only the following packages are needed to get everything working as intended:

- zsh
- git
- curl
- unzip

**If your operating system is supported, the script will make sure you have everything correctly installed.**

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Warbacon/zunder-zsh.git
    ```

2. Enter the cloned repository and run the `install.sh` script:

    ```sh
    cd ./zunder-zsh
    ./install.sh
    ```

And everything should be ready.

## üñåÔ∏è Customizing zunder-zsh

You can add custom configurations to zunder-zsh in `~/.config/zsh/user-config.zsh`
to make sure that it's not overwritten if you update zunder-zsh.

Here are some additional settings you can add:

### Change the symbol and its color in the prompt's character

Zunder-zsh uses [zunder-prompt](https://github.com/Warbacon/zunder-prompt) as
its prompt. To customize its symbol and color, you can modify
the following environment variables:

```bash
ZUNDER_PROMPT_CHAR="‚ùØ"             # default value: "ÔÉß"
ZUNDER_PROMPT_CHAR_COLOR="green"   # default value: 3 ("yellow")
```

`ZUNDER_PROMPT_CHAR_COLOR` does accept any color between 0 and 255
or a color name.

### Customize fzf theme

Maybe bothers you that the colorscheme of `fzf` is different from the theme
you set in your terminal. The `fzf` theme can be changed so you might want to do that.

Here is an example changing the colorscheme to Catppuccin Mocha:

```zsh
export FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS=" \
    --color=bg+:#313244,bg:#1e1e2e,spinner:#f5e0dc,hl:#f38ba8 \
    --color=fg:#cdd6f4,header:#f38ba8,info:#cba6f7,pointer:#f5e0dc \
    --color=marker:#f5e0dc,fg+:#cdd6f4,prompt:#cba6f7,hl+:#f38ba8"
```

All the Catppuccin presets are in [catppuccin/fzf](https://github.com/catppuccin/fzf).

You can see more in [tinted-theming/base16-fzf](https://github.com/tinted-theming/base16-fzf/tree/main/bash).
Sourcing one of them should do the work:

```zsh
source "$ZDOTDIR/your-theme.config"
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

Zunder-zsh is under constant development, so errors may occur. I suggest you open an issue and **I'll help you as fast as I can**.
Anyway, if you didn't like it or want to go back to your previous configuration, you can run the ``uninstall.sh`` script located in this same repository:

```bash
./uninstall.sh
```

Additionally, if you used previously another shell, you can revert it using the following command:

```bash
sudo usermod -s $(which bash) $USER
```

You can change bash for the shell of your choice.

### Man command highlighting as error in Arch Linux

Just run these commands if you are using `man-db` (most likely):

```bash
sudo mandb
sudo systemctl enable man-db.timer
```

## üìÉ Extra info

Zunder is in very active development and it's constantly evolving,
so you should check the project frequently to find out the latest news.
**I appreciate that bugs are reported and new ideas are suggested.**
